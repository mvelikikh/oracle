<p>There has been a tweet recently saying that VARRAY is faster than CLOB: <a href="https://twitter.com/dbms_xtender/status/1469476734240178178">link</a>. On this data set with SQL*Plus, the correctness of this statement largely depends on the underlying hardware on the database, and the network between the client and the server. More specifically, VARRAY will be faster with a rather slow network.</p>
<p>A typical production environment that I work with includes one or more databases deploying across different availability zones (AZ) on the cloud. The applications reside in the same AZ as the database server to avoid inter-AZ traffic that costs extra money. I tested the script from <a href="https://gist.github.com/xtender/4ccc1bcae16883c0f1e80a0fb8404963">this Gist</a> across two major cloud providers and VARRAY was never faster than CLOB. In fact, it is significantly slower. See the output from 19.13 below (the script is from <a href="https://gist.github.com/xtender/4ccc1bcae16883c0f1e80a0fb8404963">this Gist</a> - I just added the last query with DBMS_LOB):</p>

<p><b>NB</b>: the DBMS_LOB query is not mentioned in the original tweet, but I wrote why SUBSTR should not be used against LOB's in 2019: <a href="https://mvelikikh.blogspot.com/2019/10/temporary-lobs.html">Temporary LOBs</a>.</p>
<p>As I said, it is quite a typical cloud environment in which the client is on a different VM from the DB server. I can get even better results with CLOB if I run the same script on the DB server itself or use a proximity placement group (Azure)/cluster placement group (AWS).</p>
<p>It can be seen that there is twice as much data transfered with CLOB than with the other queries (<b>50MB</b> vs <b>25MB</b>). It is a known issue that was already observed by several other authors, e.g. <a href="https://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2019/08/01/lob-reads/">LOB reads</a>. In the specific example from this post, the extra CLOB data will become noticeable on a slow network, e.g. me pulling data from a different continent on a mobile broadband. It is not the case in most environments (including non-productions) that I work with - CLOB will be faster than VARRAY (<b>1.5 seconds</b> vs <b>14.16 seconds</b>). As always, rather than relying on any information, such as the tweet above, it is better to test it for yourself as this post demonstrates.</p>
