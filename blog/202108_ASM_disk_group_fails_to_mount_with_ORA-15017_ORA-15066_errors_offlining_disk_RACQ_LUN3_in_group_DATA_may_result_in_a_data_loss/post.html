<p>It's a test 21c cluster that wasn't shutdown properly yesterday. While mounting a DATA disk group, the following errors are encountered:</p>
<pre class='brush:sql'>

Mounting the disk group with the FORCE option is not possible either and fails with the same errors:

<p>The alert log shows that the RACQ$LUN3 disk is brought offline first and then put online. It can also be seen that ASM corrected the issue itself. The 'for recovery' mount option used to be documented somewhere on MOS, but I cannot find where it is now. Looks like Oracle Support made the document non-public.</p>
<p>
I can now remount the disk group cleanly:
